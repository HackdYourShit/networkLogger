        <h1>APNS Push Notification Tester</h1>
        <p>xAPNS is a Web Tool which lets you send Push Notifications Messages to your iOS Device. While working on one of my app, I've faced difficulty to test push notification while development. So, I decided to create a tool which will solve such issue. In this app you can customize the payload as per your need. For further details, refer to README file. </p>

        <h1>IPA Build Distrubution Tool</h1>
        <p>If you're a iOS Developer, then you must have heard about <stong>diawi</stong>. It's a website which will help you to distribute the IPA file globally with your friends or family. So, I wanted to creat something like this to overcome the drawback in diawi i.e. Build Expiration time is three days. And, I wanted mt build to last long unless I remove it. So, this web tool is basically a IPA distribution tool. Doing the same shit what diawi is doing for world. #LetsCreateYourOwn </p>

        <p>InApp Purchase was my first assignment when I started to work on iOS Profestionally. Over the years, I've grown as developer and decide to make this InApp Code Reusable so that I can use this piece again without any hazzel. So, Here it is :/    </p>

        <h1>CoreLocationHelper.swift</h1>
        <p>CoreLocation Helper is a reusable class which is actually a wrapper around CoreLocation.framework features. Say, You want to work on Location based service then, you can use this code to implement core functionality without any hazel. It's based on Closure Pattern and Observer Pattern (i.e. Notifications). Along with this, I've coved Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding.</p>

        <h1>Network Logger Script</h1>
        <p>Again, This also a tool which is based on NodeJS and MongoDb. There was a day, when I saw my Network Guy logging Downloading, Uploading Speed in the spreadsheet. He used to do this on regular basis - and, this made me to create a basic script for him which 'll do the task.</p>

        <h1>RaspberryPi with AWS</h1>
        <p>My Love for RapberryPi is immortal. It gives me immense pleasure when I explore something new in RaspberryPi. And, I'm like- "Oh, I can also do this" . My Python exposure is limited to RaspberryPi. So, AWS + Raspberry Pi is a deadly combination. I'll put my POC here when I complete my article. </p>
